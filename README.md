# Real-time Moving Object Detection using OpenCV

This project focuses on real-time moving object detection using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library in Python. The objective is to detect moving objects from a live video stream captured by a webcam and visualize their presence in the frame.

## Overview

Moving object detection is an essential task in computer vision with applications in various domains such as surveillance, security, and traffic monitoring. This project utilizes OpenCV to detect moving objects in real-time from a live video feed.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Moving objects are detected in real-time from the live video stream captured by the webcam.
- **Background Subtraction**: The project utilizes background subtraction techniques to identify regions of motion in the video frames.
- **Bounding Box Visualization**: Detected moving objects are highlighted with bounding boxes to visually indicate their positions.
- **Simple User Interface**: The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for real-time moving object detection.

## Usage

1. **Capture Setup**: Ensure the webcam is properly connected and the camera feed is visible.
2. **Object Detection**: Run the script to initiate moving object detection from the live video feed.
3. **Real-time Visualization**: Detected moving objects will be highlighted with bounding boxes in real-time.
4. **Interaction**: No user interaction is required during the moving object detection process. Press the 'q' key to exit the application.

## Dependencies

- OpenCV
- Imutils

## File Structure

- `moving_object_detection.py`: Python script containing the code for real-time moving object detection using OpenCV.
